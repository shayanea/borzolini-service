## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

None - all endpoints require authentication

### Protected Endpoints

- `POST /pets` - Create a new pet
- `GET /pets` - Get all pets with filtering and pagination
- `GET /pets/my-pets` - Get current user's pets
- `GET /pets/:id` - Get pet by ID
- `PATCH /pets/:id` - Update pet
- `DELETE /pets/:id` - Soft delete pet
- `DELETE /pets/:id/hard` - Hard delete pet (admin only)

### Special Endpoints

- `GET /pets/stats` - Get pet statistics (admin/vet/staff only)
- `GET /pets/species/:species` - Get pets by species
- `GET /pets/needing-vaccination` - Get pets needing vaccination (admin/vet/staff only)
- `GET /pets/needing-spay-neuter` - Get pets needing spay/neuter (admin/vet/staff only)
- `POST /pets/validate` - Validate pet data without creating

## Business Logic

### Pet Creation

- Automatically associates pet with authenticated user
- Calculates size category based on weight if not provided
- Validates owner existence
- Supports date of birth conversion

### Access Control

- Users can only access their own pets
- Admins, veterinarians, and staff can access all pets
- Role-based filtering and statistics access

### Health Tracking

- Vaccination status monitoring
- Spay/neuter status tracking
- Medical history and behavioral notes
- Allergy and medication management

## Dependencies

- **UsersModule**: For user validation and owner relationships
- **TypeORM**: For database operations and entity management
- **Auth Guards**: JWT authentication and role-based access control

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Pet

```typescript
const newPet = await petsService.create(
  {
    name: 'Buddy',
    species: PetSpecies.DOG,
    breed: 'Golden Retriever',
    gender: PetGender.MALE,
    date_of_birth: '2020-03-15',
    weight: 45.5,
    is_vaccinated: true,
    is_spayed_neutered: true,
  },
  userId
);
```

### Filtering Pets

```typescript
const filters: PetFilters = {
  species: PetSpecies.DOG,
  is_vaccinated: false,
  search: 'Golden',
};

const result = await petsService.findAll(filters, 1, 10);
```

### Getting Statistics

```typescript
const stats = await petsService.getPetStats();
console.log(`Total pets: ${stats.total}`);
console.log(`Dogs: ${stats.bySpecies[PetSpecies.DOG]}`);
console.log(`Average age: ${stats.averageAge} years`);
```

## Database Schema

The pets table includes:

- UUID primary key
- Owner relationship (foreign key to users table)
- Appointment relationships (one-to-many with clinic_appointments)
- Comprehensive health and behavioral tracking fields
- Timestamps for creation and updates
- Soft delete support via is_active flag

## Future Enhancements
